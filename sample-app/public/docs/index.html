      <h2>About Natural Living</h2>

    <section id="philosophy">
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to a philosophy of intentional living. Every table, chair, and cabinet we create is born from a mindset of respect—for materials, for the environment, and for the people who use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        By sourcing responsibly harvested wood and partnering with artisans who honor the integrity of natural materials, we ensure that each piece is as ethical as it is elegant.
